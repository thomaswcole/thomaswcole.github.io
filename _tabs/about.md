Hi, I’m **Thomas**, a graduate student at **Columbia University**, where I’m pursuing a master’s in **mathematical finance**. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at **McGill University**, majoring in **mathematics** and minoring in **finance**.

I’m passionate about the applications of **mathematics** and **statistics** in finance, especially in developing quantitative strategies and understanding market dynamics. I also enjoy exploring **personal finance** and diving into general mathematical theories.

This site is a place to share the projects I’ve worked on and write about topics that I enjoy.
