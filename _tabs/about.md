Hi, I’m Thomas, a graduate student at Columbia University, where I’m pursuing a master’s in mathematical finance. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at McGill University where I completed a major in mathematics and a minor in finance.

I’m passionate about the applications of mathematics and statistics in finance, especially in developing quantitative strategies and understanding market dynamics. I also enjoy exploring personal finance and diving into general mathematical theories.

This site is a place to share the projects I’ve worked on and write about topics that I enjoy.
