## **Introduction**

This post is another installment of a year-long series where Iâ€™ll be exploring various topics in quantitative finance. Again, you can expect one of these every month. To read the very first, please see the following link: **HERE**.

In the previous post (if you didn't see it), we covered properties of returns, which are for obvious reasons crucial to the investment process. After all, everyone likes portfolios that generates returns - so it pays to understand them, literally. For such reasons, this month I'll focus on measures of risk, and how we can think about it in our portfolios.
