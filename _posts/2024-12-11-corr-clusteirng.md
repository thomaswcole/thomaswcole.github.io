## **Introduction**

In this short post I'll be providing a summary and relevant background of a project that I recently compeleted. This project takes inspiration from Correlation Matrix Clustering for Statistical Arbitrage Portfolios by Cartea et al. (2023). In my replication of the paper, I follow the same generalized approach but make improvements, and test various aspects of the implementation. To view the code that was utilized to generate the figures and results below, please refer to my GitHub - which is linked below.

The main motivation for myself, and hopefully of interest to the reader, is to review classical clustering algorithms and demnostrate in which capacity (one of many) they can be employed in quantiative finance. 

## **Clustering**

As a primer, let's first review the clustering algorithms that will be implemented.
