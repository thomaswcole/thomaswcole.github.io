### **Introduction**

In this post, we'll be exploring the role of diversification in portfolio management, the different approaches to doing it and understanding it. One of the main motivations for this post is that the talk of diversification benefits has recently filled my Twitter (X) feed. Even more over, I recently competed in (and won) the 2025 IAQF Academic Student Competition, where in our paper we explored the effects that market concentration can have on investors. If you'd like to read the original problem and our paper, you can do so [here](https://tinyurl.com/4u397j9a).

In the next few sections, we'll try to answer the following question: Where do the benefits of diversification really lie, and why shouldn't I, like many of those on r/WallStreetsBets just go all in (maybe even with leverage)? 

### **Motivation**

Perhaps one of the first things taught in many portfolio management courses is that: "diversification is the only free lunch". Yet, when we examine some of the most sucessful investors of our time, they are famously known for taking highly concentrated positions, and being rewarded greatly for them (Warren Buffert, George Soros etc.). So what gives? Why are they not taking their free lunch? 

For arguments sake, lets ignore those "outliers" above. Now consider this fact: In 2024, it has been reported that 53% of the returns within the SP500, were attributed to just seven companies. These seven companies have become known as the Magnificent Seven, they are: AAPL, TSLA, META, GOOG, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN. In the chart below is their annualized returns against the SP500. I've also overlayed an equally weighted portfolio of these MAG7 stocks.

**CHART**

Then, let's look at the relative beta contribution of this mag7 universe to the SP500. That is, we take the weighted beta of the MAG7 and multiply it by their weight in the index. The chart below will show you that most of the beta within this index has become dominated by these few stocks.

**CHART**

Hopefully, from these chart alone my argument is fairly clear- why should I invest in a diversified (is it even) ETF like the SP500 instead of going all in on these seven stocks? Quantiatively, the equal weight mag7 portfolio outperformed the SP500 over this period by roughly 50%. If we even further tilted that  portfolio to be more heavily NVDA then of course we could have done even better.
