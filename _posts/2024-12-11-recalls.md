### Background

During the final year of my undergraduate degree at McGill I wanted to gain more pratical experience in investment management. I found a course, Applied Investments that was being offered. The course was a year long and involved students developing, implementing and refining an investment strategy. A unique aspect of this course, is that the students managed real money. More precisley, a portion of the endowment was allocated to the course for students to manage. My group and I managed ~250,000CAD. 

To provide a brief summary of our strategy, we believed that large automotive recalls would create temporary negative price effects on the automotive companies stock price.  You can read more about the strategy **here**.

The purpose of this is to discuss the data retrieval process and how you can use the tool that I built as apart of this project.


### The Data

To execute our trading strategy we required consistent access to update to date recall information. Fortunately, the automotive industry is highly regulated and thus requires strict reporting. As a result, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is a department of the US Government provides an API to allow users to search for recalls placed on their vehicle. 

The issue with this is that while their API provides the ability to search by Make, Model, Year or even VIN, there is no direct way to understand which recalls have been entered today or even to aggregate all of this information.

I wrote a Python package **recalls**, which allows a user to do this. Below I detail how one might use this.
