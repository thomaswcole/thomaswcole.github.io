### **Introduction**

In this post we take a look at perhaps one the most well known and intuitive trading strategies, which is still heavily pursued by many hedge funds, and continues to generate signifigant returns- this strategy is known as trend following. Throughout the post, we'll first begin by defining trend following, its history and some empirical evidence of the strategy. Then we'll look at how the current market environment has impacted "trendies", why that is, and how we can surmount this. Finally, I'll test these methods in two asset classes; equities and crypto currencies. 

### **What is trend following?**

The core of trend following is fairly simplisitic in nature, buy when the price is trending upwards with the expectation that it will continue that way, or the opposite when the price is trending in the wrong direction. This strategy is fairly similar to a traditional momentum strategy but is typically based solely on price. As a result, signal generation will often come from price based targets such as a 20day moving average, or moving average cross-overs.

#### Economic Rationale

A central peice to any trading strategy, is the economic rationale for why such a strategy should work. For trend following, this can be rationalized in many different ways. First, one might look to the behaviour of investors, and their tendency to FOMO into stocks which are performing well, and panic sell out of those which are performing poorly; both of which can accentuate the trend. Secondly, the success could be structural in that given the large amount hedge funds pursuing such strategies and thus likely buying and selling large quantites around the same time, the trading strategy could be self reinforcing. 

#### Empirical Evidence

Now that we've had a brief introduction to what trend following is, and the economic rationale behind the strategy, we examine its empirical performance.
